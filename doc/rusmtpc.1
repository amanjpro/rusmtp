.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rusmtpc
A simple client to talk to the rusmtpd daemon for sending emails.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-rusmtprc=\fIPATH_TO_SMTPDRC\fR
An option to specify an alternative configuration file for the daemon. By
default the daemon reads from $HOME/.rusmtprc, but this option overrides it. An
example configuration file is already installed in $HOME/.rusmtprc.
.TP
.BR \-\-account=\fIACCOUNT_NAME\fR
The account on which the email should be sent. If none is provided, the
default account would.
.TP
.BR \-\-with\-retry
If set, rusmtpc will retry to attempt sending email until it succeeds, this
particularly useful for cron emails. But if the client is used with email
clients such as NeoMutt, this option should not be passed, to avoid double
sending the same email.
.TP
.BR \-\-
A \-\- signals the end of options and disables further option
processing. Any arguments after the \-\- are treated as recipients.
